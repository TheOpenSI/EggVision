ðŸ¥š EggVision  
EggVision is an iOS-based capstone project that classifies egg types (chicken or quail) and predicts the gender of unhatched chicks for chicken eggs using LiDAR-based shape analysis. It offers a humane and efficient solution to reduce the mass culling of male chicks in the poultry industry by analyzing egg morphology.

Features  
- Detect and classify egg type (chicken or quail) using CoreML  
- Predict chick gender for chicken eggs using Shape Index  
- Automatically measure egg dimensions using LiDAR and SceneKit  
- Manual input option for Shape Index-based predictions  
- Clean SwiftUI interface

Gender Prediction Logic  
This app uses a rule-based gender prediction system based on the threshold values from Kayadan & Uzun (2023). No separate machine learning model is used for gender classification.

Formula:  
Shape Index (SI) = Short Axis / Long Axis

If SI > 0.50 â†’ Likely Female  
If SI â‰¤ 0.50 â†’ Likely Male

Measurements can be taken automatically using LiDAR or entered manually by the user.
